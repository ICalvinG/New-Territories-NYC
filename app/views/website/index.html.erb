    	<p>New Territories was created in 2016 with the mission to bring traditional Hong Kong eats and sweets with a bit of New York flavor.

  		<p>Situated in the heart of Lower East Side, New York, the interior was designed to create an inviting, gallery-like atmosphere with a few visual pieces to parallel the neighboring art galleries.
